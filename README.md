# Personal Website

If you have any notes, questions, or other general comments for us to read, please put
them in this README! Good luck and have fun :)

===========================================================================

Good Evening Chuck & Woody, 

Please note the following regarding my Personal Website:

1. Initially, I forked the repo and pushed my iniial commit to that repo, however, the FullStack Academy HelpDesk redirected me to create a new repository all together and delete the forked repository, so that I would have more read/write privileges even after the class is over (or in the event that the initial owner changes permissions on the forked repository). Consequently, this newer repository doesn't show the initial fork taking place. The HelpDesk suggested that I mention this so that I don't get docked on the rubric for the fork no longer being visible in the newer repository.

2. All of my Website Pages are console logged with my name.

3. The responsive media CSS appears at the bottom of each CSS page so that it did not override the code elsewhere on the page.

Screenshots of the Finished Personal Website are below for reference:
